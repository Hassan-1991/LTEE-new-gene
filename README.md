Codes used for analyzing RNA-seq and Ribo-Seq data in the forthcoming manuscript, "Emergence and persistence of proto-genes in a long-term Escherichia coli evolution experiment", uz-Zaman et al.

The read mapping, counting and differential expression analyses were done with Bowtie2, htseq-count, and DESeq2 respectively. This repository contains the novel scripts used for the analysis, specifically to generate the different transcriptomes used in the study.
