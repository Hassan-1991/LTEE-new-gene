#For the 400bp windows, I want to test these hypotheses:

1 - Amount of annotated:non-annotated stuff goes up/down with time
  a) Sum(TPM)? - Basically, what fraction of the 10^6 are unannotated, can be represented as relative
  b) Mean(TPM)? Average TPM of non-annotated, idk if this is relative to annotated
2 - Number of annotated and/or no-annotated windows goes up/down with time
